<p>Multilingual OCR with EasyOCR and Hugging Face Transformers
About
Welcome to the Multilingual OCR repository! This project leverages the power of EasyOCR, a comprehensive and easy-to-use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) library, to extract text from images in multiple languages. Additionally, it integrates a translation transformer model from Hugging Face to translate the extracted text into various languages.

Key Features
EasyOCR Integration: Utilize pre-trained models from EasyOCR to recognize text from images in over 6 languages.
Translation Transformer: Translate the extracted text into different languages using state-of-the-art transformer models from Hugging Face.
Multilingual Support: Handle a variety of languages for both OCR and translation tasks.
Ease of Use: Simple and straightforward implementation, making it accessible for developers of all levels.
Components
EasyOCR: An OCR library that provides pre-trained models capable of recognizing text in multiple languages with high accuracy.
Hugging Face Transformers: A collection of transformer models for translation tasks, allowing for seamless language translation of the recognized text.
Applications
Document Digitization: Convert printed or handwritten text in different languages into digital text.
Language Translation: Translate recognized text into various languages for multilingual support.
Data Extraction: Extract and translate text from images for data analysis and processing.</p>
